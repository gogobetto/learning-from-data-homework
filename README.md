# "Learning from data" course homework in Pyton and Clojure

My homework solutions for the "Learning from data" [course](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) by Caltech, in the hope that they will be useful to some future Googlers.

I had set out to solve all the challenges in Clojure, but all the quadratic programming packages I could find required unhealthy amounts of Java interop. I ended up implementing the SVM problems using Python and the *sk_learn*'s wrappers for *libsvm*, and it was a really smooth experience.
